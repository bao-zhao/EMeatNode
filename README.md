# Compact IoT Board for Electromechanical Metamaterials

![IoT Board](pics/PCB1.png) 

This repository contains the open-source design files for a compact, self-powered IoT board featuring the SECE AC-DC interface circuit, the three-transistor energy management module for DC-DC conversion, and an ultra-low-power Bluetooth Beacon for sensing and transmission.

## Key Features

- **Energy Harvesting Interface**: Compatible with the SECE (Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction) interface circuit and the full bridge rectifier.
- **Three-Transistor Energy Management**: 
  - Adjustable regulation voltage thresholds (`V_ON` and `V_OFF`)
  - Regulated output voltage ~2.3V (suitable for most IoT SoCs)
- **Ultra-Low-Power Bluetooth Beacon**:
  - IN100 SoC for internal temperature and VCC sensing
  - BMA400 accelerometer via IÂ²C
  - Bluetooth broadcasting (channels 37-39) at 1s intervals
- **Power-Saving Operation**:
  - Dynamic sleep/wake cycles
  - Load switch for external sensor power management
- **Configurable Thresholds**:
  - Adjustable `V_ON` via onboard resistor `R5` selection
  - Supports heavy-sensing and transmission tasks
